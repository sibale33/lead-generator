## Installation

To get started with Lead Generator, follow these steps:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sibale33/lead-generator.git
   cd lead-generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

## Usage

After installation, you can start using Lead Generator. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to send personalized emails:

```bash
node lead-generator send --file leads.csv --template template.html
```

This command will read your leads from a CSV file and use the specified HTML template to send emails.

## Configuration

Before you can send emails or make calls, you need to configure your settings. Create a configuration file named `config.json` in the root directory:

```json
{
  "mailgun": {
    "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "domain": "YOUR_DOMAIN"
  },
  "voice": {
    "apiKey": "YOUR_VOICE_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_DOMAIN` with your Mailgun credentials, and `YOUR_VOICE_API_KEY` with your voice API credentials.

## Commands

Here are some of the main commands you can use:

### Send Emails

To send emails, use the following command:

```bash
node lead-generator send --file leads.csv --template template.html
```

### Make Voice Calls

To initiate voice calls, use:

```bash
